# WordPress Sandbox Repository

Welcome to my WordPress Sandbox repository! This repository serves as a dedicated environment for testing, developing plugins, themes, and blocks for WordPress. Whether I'm developing new features, experimenting with design elements, or simply testing changes in a controlled environment, this WordPress Sandbox is designed to support my development needs.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to provide a safe and isolated space for WordPress development. Here are some key reasons for using this sandbox:

- **Testing**: Easily test new plugins, themes, or blocks without affecting a live WordPress site.
  
- **Development**: Develop and iterate on WordPress-related projects in a controlled environment.

- **Experimentation**: Safely experiment with different configurations, settings, and functionalities.

## Current Projects:

### Dynamic Gutenberg Custom Block

The primary focus of this repository is the development of a dynamic Gutenberg Custom Block. This block aims to offer flexibility and control over how posts are presented on the front page. Here are some key features of the custom block:
- **Location:** [`wp-content/plugins/dynamic-block` ](https://github.com/Zagaz/WPSandbox/tree/main/wp-content/plugins/dynamic-block "The code")

- **Customizable Sidebar**: Users can easily adjust settings via the sidebar, allowing for fine-tuning of the displayed posts.
  - **Number of Posts**: Specify the number of posts to be displayed on the front page.
  - **Order**: Choose the order in which posts are presented. 
  - **Author**: Filter posts by author, providing a more personalized experience.
  - **Categories**: Categorize and display posts based on user preferences.

- **Element Visibility**: Users have the freedom to choose which elements will be displayed on the front end. This ensures a tailored and seamless integration with your website.
